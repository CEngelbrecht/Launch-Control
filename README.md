# Launch-Control
This is the repository for the Launch Control client and server software for the SDSU Rocket Project. 

Launch_Control_Server.py should be placed in the home/pi folder on the Raspberry Pi that will be controlling the launch. 

Launch_Control_Client.py requires Python 2.7 and the Tkinter package. 


For a stand-alone application, download the dist folder and run "Launch Control Client.exe"
